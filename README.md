# Exam Timer ‚è≤Ô∏è

Welcome to **Exam Timer**, a web-based timer application designed to keep track of exam durations accurately, even in the event of unexpected interruptions. 

## Why Exam Timer? ü§î

### There are countless timer projects available online, so why create a new one? Here's the story behind Exam Timer:

During one of my exams, the teacher used a random online timer projected on a screen. Unfortunately, halfway through the exam, a power outage reset the timer. When the power was restored, the teacher restarted the timer but reduced the remaining time inaccurately. I was certain the time wasn't correct, but I couldn't argue without wasting more time. This experience inspired me to develop a timer that saves its state in local storage, ensuring accurate time tracking even after interruptions.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Persistent Timer**: Saves the timer state in local storage, so it continues accurately even if the session is restarted.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI for easy use during exams.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust the timer duration to fit any exam length.

## Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Next.js 15**: The latest version of Next.js for a robust and scalable React application framework.
- **shadcn UI**: A sleek and modern UI component library.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **TypeScript**: Typed JavaScript for better code quality and developer experience.
